# Functions in _The Little Schemer_

This is a collection of functions and implementations in _The Little Schemer_ by **Daniel P. Friedman** and **Matthias Felleisen**. It is also the exercise book I used to learn the Scheme programming language and functional programming.

For some of the functions, I have also included my own implementations, though mine are always commented out.
